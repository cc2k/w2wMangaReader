Ideas:
- make it simple to switch sources when a manga is not loading on a source for ie.
- make it free, or otherwise research if adds are "allowed"
- rating system for manga (jenn)
- scrolling through pages while reading them instead of per page swap (jenn)
- light/dark, maybe different modes?
- use 2 identifiers, 1 for source 1 for manga
- use a mangasource class or a source and handeling?


- let the viewer choose what search option they want for looking up manga
