- make a last read section
- make updates page, where all updated manga's are shown
- make a collection section
- make a categories/tag section
- make a settings page
- make a db for storing users and their collection
- research if its smarter to use a different db than json
- research and implement sidebar navigation  -- DONE
- make search possible into all galleries
- make the app faster and cleaner
- make a source selection page, check marking which sources to use
- firebase or make an api so you can check user info(collections stuff) -i need help with this part!! Jasper is helping with this
- make a tab layout in mainActivity? so MangasSearch can select multiple sources to search? ?
- local collection/cloud collection how to implement it



Ideas:
- make it simple to switch sources when a manga is not loading on a source for ie.
- make it free, or otherwise research if adds are "allowed"
- rating system for manga (jenn)
- scrolling through pages while reading them instead of per page swap (jenn)
- light/dark, maybe different modes?
- use 2 identifiers, 1 for source 1 for manga
- use a mangasource class or a source and handling?
- popup menus use icons? got errors before
-  collections per source left to right scroll?




- let the viewer choose what search option they want for looking up manga
